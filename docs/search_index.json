In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq provides quantitative measurements of the expression of every gene in a single cell. However, to analyze scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some of the underlying assumptions for the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid. In this course we will cover all steps of the scRNA-seq processing, starting from the raw reads coming off the sequencer. The course includes common analysis strategies, using state-of-the-art methods and we also discuss the central biological questions that can be addressed using scRNA-seq. 1.2 TARGETED AUDIENCE &amp; ASSUMED BACKGROUND This course is aimed at researchers and technical workers who are or will be analyzing scRNA-seq data. The material is suitable both for experimentalists who want to learn more about data-analysis as well as computational biologists who want to learn about scRNASeq methods. Examples demonstrated in this course can be applied to any experimental protocol or biological system. The requirements for this course are: 1. Working knowledge of unix (managing files, running programs) 2. Programming experience in R (writing a function, basic I/O operations, variable types, using packages). Bioconductor experience is a plus. 3. Familiarity with next-generation sequencing data and its analyses (using alignment and quantification tools for bulk sequencing data) 1.3 COURSE FORMAT The course will be delivered over the course of five days. Each day will include a lecture and laboratory component. The lecture will introduce the topics of discussion and the laboratory sessions will be focused on practical hands-on analysis of scRNA-seq data. These sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as applying these skills on your own to complete individual exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a group. Computing will be done using a combination of tools installed on the attendees laptop computer and web resources accessed via web browser. 1.4 Getting Started 1.5 SESSION CONTENT 1.5.1 Monday Classes from 08:00 to 16:00 (lunch break-1 hr, 40 min of total coffee breaks) Shared Google doc - course notes, ideas/questions/challenges/interesting topics you would like to explore. 1.5.1.1 Lecture 1 – scRNA-Seq experimental design (Orr) Overview of course General introduction: cell atlas overviews Comparison of Bulk and single cell RNA-Seq Overview of available scRNA-seq technologies (10x) and experimental protocols scRNA-Seq experimental design and analysis workflow? 1.5.1.2 Lab 1 – Understanding sequencing raw data, downloading Docker if not done already (Kirk) Lab based around data wrangling from public data repositories: get data from 10x website, single cell portal, from GEO (fastqs, counts) - Shell and Unix commands to navigate directories, create folders, open files - Raw file formats 1.5.1.3 Lecture 2-3 - Intro to Data processing: from bcl file to bam file Transcriptome quantification: from bam file to counts (Dana) scRNA-Seq processing workflow starting with choice of sequencer (NextSeq, HiSeq, MiSeq) / barcode swapping and bcl files Overview of Popular tools and algorithms Common single-cell analyses and interpretation Sequencing data: alignment and quality control Looking at cool things in alignment like where reads are, mutations, splicing Read &amp; UMI counting (Kallisto alignment-free pseudocounts as well), how RSEM works (length dependence, sequencing depth, multimapping reads), CellRanger (dropest), bustools 10x barcode structure and links to Perturb-seq Gene length &amp; coverage Gene expression units (count data Smart-seq2 counts or 10x UMIs vs expression data) 1.5.1.4 Lab 2 – Processing raw scRNA-Seq data (Dana), Docker setup (Kirk) Data outputs from different scRNAseq technologies (10x, Smart-seq2) - process both?

For this task, today we will be using a tool called FastQC. FastQC is a quality control tool for sequencing data, which can be used for both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. FastQC takes sequencing data as input and returns a report on read quality. Copy and paste this link into your browser to visit the FastQC website: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ This website contains links to download and install FastQC and documentation on the reports produced. Fortunately we have already installed FastQC for you today, so instead we will take a look at the documentation. Scroll down the webpage to ‘Example Reports’ and click ‘Good Illumina Data’. This gives an example of what an ideal report should look like for high quality Illumina reads data. Now let’s make a FastQC report ourselves. Today we will be performing our analysis using a single cell from an mESC dataset produced by (Kolodziejczyk et al. 2015), which you downloaded froom the github link. The cells were sequenced using the SMART-seq2 library preparation protocol and the reads are paired end. First, let’s open the docker in a bash mode. open a terminal, cd to the docer folder (the folder you downloaded from github) and run this command: docker run --rm -ti -v $PWD:/home/rstudio -e DISABLE_AUTH=true kdgosik/2020scworkshop bash navigate to your data folder: cd home/rstudio/lab2data ls You should see the files that you downloaded from the dropbox link. Now let’s look at the files: less Teichmann_2i_2_2_1.fastq less Teichmann_2i_2_2_2.fastq We run fastqc from /usr/local/src/FastQC. You may need to give yourself permissions to run the file (hint: chmod) Task 1: run fastqc to view the quality of the reads chmod 755 /usr/local/src/FastQC/fastqc /usr/local/src/FastQC/fastqc -h This command will tell you what options are available to pass to FastQC. Let us direct our output to our personal directories (under the folder results). Feel free to ask for help if you get stuck! If you are successful, you should generate a .zip and a .html file for both the forwards and the reverse reads files. Once you have been successful, feel free to have a go at the next section. /usr/local/src/FastQC/fastqc -o &lt;output_folder&gt; Teichmann_2i_2_2_1.fastq Teichmann_2i_2_2_2.fastq Once the command has finished executing, you should have a total of four files - one zip file for each of the paired end reads, and one html file for each of the paired end reads. The report is in the html file. for those working in AWS, if you want to view the file you will need to download it to your computer. The scp command is: scp -r -i &lt;your pem file&gt; &lt;username&gt;@ec2-34-213-180-241.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/&lt;file to copy&gt; &lt;destination in your computer&gt; Once the file is on you computer, click on it. Your FastQC report should open. Have a look through the file. Remember to look at both the forwards and the reverse end read reports! How good quality are the reads? Is there anything we should be concerned about? 4.3.1 Fastq file format FastQ is the most raw form of scRNASeq data you will encounter. All scRNASeq protocols are sequenced with paired-end sequencing. Barcode sequences may occur in one or both reads depending on the protocol employed. However, protocols using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) will generally contain one read with the cell and UMI barcodes plus adapters but without any transcript sequence. Thus reads will be mapped as if they are single-end sequenced despite actually being paired end. FastQ files have the format: &gt;ReadID READ SEQUENCE + SEQUENCING QUALITY SCORES 4.4 Align the reads 4.4.1 STAR align Now we have established that our reads are of good quality, we would like to map them to a reference genome. This process is known as alignment. Some form of alignment is generally required if we want to quantify gene expression or find genes which are differentially expressed between samples. Many tools have been developed for read alignment, but today we will focus on STAR. For each read in our reads data, STAR tries to find the longest possible sequence which matches one or more sequences in the reference genome. Because STAR is able to recognize splicing events in this way, it is described as a ‘splice aware’ aligner. Usually STAR aligns reads to a reference genome, potentially allowing it to detect novel splicing events or chromosomal rearrangements. However, one issue with STAR is that it needs a lot of RAM, especially if your reference genome is large (eg. mouse and human). To speed up our analysis today, we will use STAR to align reads from to a reference transcriptome of 2000 transcripts. Note that this is NOT normal or recommended practice, we only do it here for reasons of time. We recommend that normally you should align to a reference genome. Two steps are required to perform STAR alignment. In the first step, the user provides STAR with reference genome sequences (FASTA) and annotations (GTF), which STAR uses to create a genome index. In the second step, STAR maps the user’s reads data to the genome index. Let’s create the index now. Remember, for reasons of time we are aligning to a transcriptome rather than a genome today, meaning we only need to provide STAR with the sequences of the transcripts we will be aligning reads to. You can obtain transcriptomes for many model organisms from Ensembl (https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html). Task 2: Create a genome index First create the output folder for the index in your personal folder under results (recommended /home/rstudio/lab2data/STAR/indices). We run STAR from: /usr/local/src/STAR/bin/Linux_x86_64 using the command: /usr/local/src/STAR/bin/Linux_x86_64/STAR --runThreadN 4 --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir &lt;output STAR indices folder&gt; --genomeFastaFiles /home/rstudio/lab2data/2000_reference.transcripts.fa Now that we have created the index, we can perform the mapping step. Task 4: Try to work out what command you should use to map our fastq files to the index you created. Use the STAR manual to help you. Once you think you know the answer use ./STAR command to align the fastq files to a BAM file. You can either create a SAM file and convert it to BAM using samtools, or use STAR to directly output a BAM file (–outSAMtype BAM Unsorted) /usr/local/src/STAR/bin/Linux_x86_64/STAR --runThreadN 4 --genomeDir &lt;genome_reference&gt; --readFilesIn /home/rstudio/lab2data/Teichmann_2i_2_2_1.fastq /home/rstudio/lab2data/Teichmann_2i_2_2_2.fastq --outFileNamePrefix &lt;output_folder&gt; --outSAMtype BAM Unsorted The alignment may take awhile, if you wish to you can complete tasks 7-10 in the meanwhile. 4.4.2 Bam file format BAM file format stores mapped reads in a standard and efficient manner. The human-readable version is called a SAM file, while the BAM file is the highly compressed version. BAM/SAM files contain a header which typically includes information on the sample preparation, sequencing and mapping; and a tab-separated row for each individual alignment of each read. Alignment rows employ a standard format with the following columns: QNAME : read name (generally will include UMI barcode if applicable) FLAG : number tag indicating the “type” of alignment, link to explanation of all possible “types” RNAME : reference sequence name (i.e. chromosome read is mapped to). POS : leftmost mapping position MAPQ : Mapping quality CIGAR : string indicating the matching/mismatching parts of the read (may include soft-clipping). RNEXT : reference name of the mate/next read PNEXT : POS for mate/next read TLEN : Template length (length of reference region the read is mapped to) SEQ : read sequence QUAL : read quality BAM/SAM files can be converted to the other format using ‘samtools’: samtools view -S -b file.sam &gt; file.bam samtools view -h file.bam &gt; file.sam Some sequencing facilities will automatically map your reads to the a standard genome and deliver either BAM or CRAM formatted files. Generally they will not have included ERCC sequences in the genome thus no ERCC reads will be mapped in the BAM/CRAM file. To quantify ERCCs (or any other genetic alterations) or if you just want to use a different alignment algorithm than whatever is in the generic pipeline (often outdated), then you will need to convert the BAM/CRAM files back to FastQs: BAM files can be converted to FastQ using bedtools. To ensure a single copy for multi-mapping reads first sort by read name and remove secondary alignments using samtools. Picard also contains a method for converting BAM to FastQ files. Bonus: To make our aligned BAM file easy to navigate (needed for IGViewer) we will sort and index it using samtools. Sam tools can be run from everywhere (no need to go to a special directory!) using the command: samtools Let us start by sorting the BAM file: samtools sort Aligned.out.bam -o Aligned.out.sorted.bam Task 6: can you index the file? hint: try looking at samtools -h samtools index Aligned.out.sorted.bam Once you sorted and indexed the files you should have a BAM and a bai files. The BAM file is the aligned reads, and the bai is an index file. To view them in IGViewer (IGV) first copy them into your computer. Go ahead and copy the fa file as well, we will need a reference genome file. 4.5 Visualization To view the file we will use the IGV you installed on your personal computer. Open IGV: the default genomes are human HG19 and HG38. Through the class we will be using the PBMC dataset. You have the BAM file in your data folder. Go ahead and transfer it to your computer and upload it to IGV with hg38 as reference genome. Task 7: Browse to MS4A1, this is a blood cell marker. Can you see the exons and the introns? Where are most of the aligned reads? Task 8: Search in IGV or online - can you present splice junctions? (right click -&gt; “Show splice junction track”) Task 9: Try further tasks that interest you in IGV. For example, can you detect reads that are within one exon and reads that start in one exon and continue in the next? Can you copy the sequence of exon2 in MS4A1? Task 10: What would have happened if you chose the wrong reference genome, such as hg19? Bonus 2 (IGV sometimes has difficulties loading small fa files. So if this becomes difficult - don’t worry! It’s not your alignment): The default genomes are human HG19 and HG38. However you can also upload your reference genome of choice. As we created our own fasta file we can now upload it as a reference genome. Task 11: Load new genome: go to “Genomes”-&gt;”Load from file” and load the file 2000_reference.transcripts.fa Task 12: Now load your reads: go to “File”-&gt;”Load from file” and load your BAM file. Notice that IGV needs a BAM and a bai saved in the same location. IGV uses the bai to navigate through the BAM file. Task 13: Some of the reads have a nucleotide substitution in position 993 - what is the reference nucleotide? What is the substitution? "],

There are few requirements for uploading packages besides building and installing succesfully, hence documentation and support is often minimal and figuring how to use these packages can be a challenge it itself. CRAN is the default repository R will search to find packages to install: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) # or multiple packages install.packages(c(&quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;stringr&quot;)) 6.2.2 Github Github isn’t specific to R, any code of any type in any state can be uploaded. There is no guarantee a package uploaded to github will even install, nevermind do what it claims to do. R packages can be downloaded and installed directly from github using the “devtools” package installed above. ## username/repository devtools::install_github(&quot;satijalab/seurat&quot;) # latest stable version of Seurat package Github is also a version control system which stores multiple versions of any package. By default the most recent “master” version of the package is installed. If you want an older version or the development branch this can be specified using the “ref” parameter: # different branch devtools::install_github(&quot;satijalab/seurat&quot;, ref=&quot;release3.0&quot;) # previous commit ## Merge branch &#39;develop&#39; into feat/MultiModal ## - Shiwei Zheng committed on Jul 2, 2018 devtools::install_github(&quot;tallulandrews/M3Drop&quot;, ref=&quot;551014f488770627ab154a62e59d49df5df98a3f&quot;) Note: make sure you re-install the M3Drop master branch for later in the course. 6.2.3 Bioconductor Bioconductor is a repository of R-packages specifically for biological analyses. It has the strictest requirements for submission, including installation on every platform and full documentation with a tutorial (called a vignette) explaining how the package should be used. Bioconductor also encourages utilization of standard data structures/classes and coding style/naming conventions, so that, in theory, packages and analyses can be combined into large pipelines or workflows. Bioconductor also requires creators to support their packages and has a regular 6-month release schedule. Make sure you are using the most recent release of bioconductor before trying to install packages for the course. ## &gt;= R 3.5.0 if (!requireNamespace(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) BiocManager::install(&quot;Rsamtools&quot;, ask = FALSE) 6.2.4 Source The final way to install packages is directly from source. In this case you have to download a fully built source code file, usually packagename.tar.gz, or clone the github repository and rebuild the package yourself. Generally this will only be done if you want to edit a package yourself, or if for some reason the former methods have failed. You can also get previous packages that aren’t supported any more on the CRAN package archive ## Get an old package and install from source install.packages(&quot;GenABEL_1.8-0.tar.gz&quot;, type=&quot;source&quot;) 6.3 Installation instructions: All the packages necessary for this course are available here. A list of the packages will be on the README.md for the repository. A script is also available inside the docker/install.R file. 6.3.1 Classes/Types R is a high level language so the underlying data-type is generally not important. The exception if you are accessing R data directly using another language such as C, but that is beyond the scope of this course. Instead we will consider the basic data classes: numeric, integer, logical, and character, and the higher level data class called “factor”. You can check what class your data is using the “class()” function. 6.3.1.1 Integer x &lt;- 4 ## assign value of 4 to x class(x) ## check class of x ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; is.integer(x) ## check if x is an integer ## [1] FALSE is.numeric(x) ## check if x is numeric ## [1] TRUE x &lt;- as.numeric(x) ## assign y to be an numeric is.numeric(x) ## check if the assignment worked ## [1] TRUE class(x) ## check if the assignment worked ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; x ## check value of x ## [1] 4 6.3.1.2 Numeric ## assign value of 1.414 to y y &lt;- 1.414 ## check class of y class(y) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## check if y is numeric is.numeric(y) ## [1] TRUE ## check if y is an integer is.integer(y) ## [1] FALSE ## assign y to be an integer y &lt;- as.integer(y) ## check if the assignment worked is.integer(y) ## [1] TRUE ## check value of y y ## [1] 1 6.3.1.3 Logical/ Boolean The logical class stores boolean truth values, i.e. TRUE and FALSE. It is used for storing the results of logical operations and conditional statements will be coerced to this class. Most other data-types can be coerced to boolean without triggering (or “throwing”) error messages, which may cause unexpected behaviour. z &lt;- TRUE ## assign value of TRUE to z class(z) ## check class of z ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; is.logical(z) ## check if z is of logical type ## [1] TRUE 6.3.2 Data structures Homogeneous 1D: atomic vector 2D: matrix nD: array Heterogeneous 1D: list 2D: data.frame 6.3.2.1 Character Vectors ## assign a character vector with c() operator character_vector &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;) ## check class class(character_vector) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## access the 3rd element with [] operator ## *note*: R is index starts at 1 (other programming languages start at 0) character_vector[3] ## [1] &quot;T&quot; ## access 3rd through 6th elemenet character_vector[3:6] ## [1] &quot;T&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;T&quot; ## access the elements 1,4,7,10 with c() character_vector[c(1, 4, 7, 10)] ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;A&quot; ## access all the A&#39;s character_vector[grep(&quot;A&quot;, character_vector)] ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; 6.3.2.2 Numeric Vector The “numeric” class is the default class for storing any numeric data - integers, decimal numbers, numbers in scientific notation, etc… ## assign a character vector with c() operator numeric_vector &lt;- c(1, 5, 21, 17, 98, 35, 11, 13) ## check class class(numeric_vector) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## access the 5th element with [] operator numeric_vector[5] ## [1] 98 ## access 2nd through 4th elemenet numeric_vector[2:4] ## [1] 5 21 17 ## backticks ` ` allow you to give names with non-typical characters `numeric?_vecotr` &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;, 1, 5, 21, 17, 98, 35, 11, 13) ## check vector `numeric?_vecotr` ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;21&quot; &quot;17&quot; &quot;98&quot; &quot;35&quot; &quot;11&quot; &quot;13&quot; ## check class (Notice the quotation marks on the numbers!) class(`numeric?_vecotr`) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; 6.3.2.3 Factor Vector String/Character data is very memory inefficient to store, each letter generally requires the same amount of memory as any integer. Thus when storing a vector of strings with repeated elements it is more efficient assign each element to an integer and store the vector as integers and an additional string-to-integer association table. Thus, by default R will read in text columns of a data table as factors. factor_vector &lt;- factor(numeric_vector) factor_vector ## [1] 1 5 21 17 98 35 11 13 ## Levels: 1 5 11 13 17 21 35 98 6.3.2.4 Named Vector names(numeric_vector) &lt;- paste0(&quot;Patient&quot;, 1 : length(numeric_vector)) numeric_vector ## Patient1 Patient2 Patient3 Patient4 Patient5 Patient6 Patient7 Patient8 ## 1 5 21 17 98 35 11 13 6.3.2.5 List ## change the c() operator to list() operator new_list &lt;- list(&quot;A&quot;, 1, 5, 21, 17, 98, 35, 11, 13) new_list ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;A&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 5 ## ## [[4]] ## [1] 21 ## ## [[5]] ## [1] 17 ## ## [[6]] ## [1] 98 ## ## [[7]] ## [1] 35 ## ## [[8]] ## [1] 11 ## ## [[9]] ## [1] 13 ## get 2nd element of list new_list[[2]] ## [1] 1 names(new_list) &lt;- paste0(&quot;Patient&quot;, 1 : length(new_list)) new_list ## $Patient1 ## [1] &quot;A&quot; ## ## $Patient2 ## [1] 1 ## ## $Patient3 ## [1] 5 ## ## $Patient4 ## [1] 21 ## ## $Patient5 ## [1] 17 ## ## $Patient6 ## [1] 98 ## ## $Patient7 ## [1] 35 ## ## $Patient8 ## [1] 11 ## ## $Patient9 ## [1] 13 ## get 2nd element of list new_list[[2]] ## [1] 1 2D 6.3.2.6 matrix Create Matrix ## create numeric matrix numeric_matrix &lt;- matrix(sample(1:10, 100, replace = TRUE), nrow = 10, ncol = 10) class(numeric_matrix) ## check class ## [1] &quot;matrix&quot; Check Structure str(numeric_matrix) ## int [1:10, 1:10] 7 6 4 8 3 5 2 3 7 7 ...

In this lab, we will touch briefly on some of the features of the package. If you would like to learn more about how to use ggplot2, we would recommend reading “ggplot2 Elegant graphics for data analysis”, by Hadley Wickham or checking out his original paper on the package Data: Always start with the data, identify the dimensions you want to visualize. Aesthetics: Confirm the axes based on the data dimensions, positions of various data points in the plot. Also check if any form of encoding is needed including size, shape, color and so on which are useful for plotting multiple data dimensions. Scale: Do we need to scale the potential values, use a specific scale to represent multiple values or a range? Geometric objects: These are popularly known as ‘geoms’. This would cover the way we would depict the data points on the visualization. Should it be points, bars, lines and so on? Statistics: Do we need to show some statistical measures in the visualization like measures of central tendency, spread, confidence intervals? Facets: Do we need to create subplots based on specific data dimensions? Coordinate system: What kind of a coordinate system should the visualization be based on — should it be cartesian or polar? 6.5.2 Principles of ggplot2 Your data must be a dataframe if you want to plot it using ggplot2. Use the aes mapping function to specify how variables in the dataframe map to features on your plot Use geoms to specify how your data should be represented on your graph eg. as a scatterplot, a barplot, a boxplot etc. Data: Always start with the data, identify the dimensions you want to visualize. library(Seurat) library(ggplot2) gbm &lt;- pbmc_small@assays$RNA@data gbm &lt;- as.data.frame(as.matrix(t(gbm))) new_plot &lt;- ggplot(gbm) Aesthetics: Confirm the axes based on the data dimensions, positions of various data points in the plot.

We evaluated 36 approaches using experimental and synthetic data and found considerable differences in the number and characteristics of the genes that are called differentially expressed. Prefiltering of lowly expressed genes has important effects, particularly for some of the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data analysis. However, we found that bulk RNA-seq analysis methods do not generally perform worse than those developed specifically for scRNA-seq. We also present conquer, a repository of consistently processed, analysis-ready public scRNA-seq data sets that is aimed at simplifying method evaluation and reanalysis of published results. Each data set provides abundance estimates for both genes and transcripts, as well as quality control and exploratory analysis reports. (???) Cells are the basic building blocks of organisms and each cell is unique. Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as an indispensable tool to dissect the cellular heterogeneity and decompose tissues into cell types and/or cell states, which offers enormous potential for de novo discovery. Single-cell transcriptomic atlases provide unprecedented resolution to reveal complex cellular events and deepen our understanding of biological systems. In this review, we summarize and compare single-cell RNA sequencing technologies, that were developed since 2009, to facilitate a well-informed choice of method. The applications of these methods in different biological contexts are also discussed. We anticipate an ever-increasing role of single-cell RNA sequencing in biology with further improvement in providing spatial information and coupling to other cellular modalities. In the future, such biological findings will greatly benefit medical research. (???) 8.2 Seurat Tutorial Redo For this tutorial, we will be analyzing the a dataset of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) freely available from 10X Genomics.

The goal of these algorithms is to learn the underlying manifold of the data in order to place similar cells together in low-dimensional space. Cells within the graph-based clusters determined above should co-localize on these dimension reduction plots. As input to the UMAP and tSNE, we suggest using the same PCs as input to the clustering analysis. set.seed(2020) seurat &lt;- RunTSNE(seurat, reduction.use = &quot;pca&quot;, dims.use = 1:10, perplexity=10) # note that you can set do.label=T to help label individual clusters DimPlot(object = seurat, reduction = &quot;tsne&quot;) Task: Try using UMAP for the non-linear dimension reduction technique (hint: ?RunUMAP) set.seed(2020) seurat &lt;- RunUMAP() # note that you can set label=TRUE to help label individual clusters DimPlot() 8.2.3.1 Finding differentially expressed features (cluster biomarkers) Seurat can help you find markers that define clusters via differential expression. By default, it identifes positive and negative markers of a single cluster (specified in ident.1), compared to all other cells. FindAllMarkers automates this process for all clusters, but you can also test groups of clusters vs. each other, or against all cells. The min.pct argument requires a feature to be detected at a minimum percentage in either of the two groups of cells, and the thresh.test argument requires a feature to be differentially expressed (on average) by some amount between the two groups. You can set both of these to 0, but with a dramatic increase in time - since this will test a large number of features that are unlikely to be highly discriminatory. As another option to speed up these computations, max.cells.per.ident can be set. This will downsample each identity class to have no more cells than whatever this is set to. While there is generally going to be a loss in power, the speed increases can be significiant and the most highly differentially expressed features will likely still rise to the top. # find all markers of cluster 1 using default parameters cluster1.markers &lt;- FindMarkers(object = seurat, ident.1 = 1, min.pct = 0.25) head(cluster1.markers) Task: Try tuning different parameters.

Although well-established tools exist for such analysis in bulk RNA-seq data, methods for scRNA-seq data are just emerging. Given the special characteristics of scRNA-seq data, including generally low library sizes, high noise levels and a large fraction of so-called ‘dropout’ events, it is unclear whether DE methods that have been developed for bulk RNA-seq are suitable also for scRNA-seq.

This is where cells are not assigned to specifically only one cluster. They get assigned a score for how much the cells belong to each of the clusters (sometimes called topics). This can be helpful for when your dataset continuous processes and/or cellular states as opposed to distinct cell types. data(&quot;MouseDeng2014.FitGoM&quot;) names(MouseDeng2014.FitGoM) omega &lt;- MouseDeng2014.FitGoM$clust_6$omega annotation &lt;- data.frame( sample_id = paste0(&quot;X&quot;, c(1:NROW(omega))), tissue_label = factor(rownames(omega), levels = rev(c(&quot;zy&quot;, &quot;early2cell&quot;, &quot;mid2cell&quot;, &quot;late2cell&quot;, &quot;4cell&quot;, &quot;8cell&quot;, &quot;16cell&quot;, &quot;earlyblast&quot;, &quot;midblast&quot;, &quot;lateblast&quot;))) ) rownames(omega) &lt;- annotation$sample_id; StructureGGplot(omega = omega, annotation = annotation, palette = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, &quot;Accent&quot;), yaxis_label = &quot;Amplification batch&quot;, order_sample = TRUE, axis_tick = list(axis_ticks_length = .1, axis_ticks_lwd_y = .1, axis_ticks_lwd_x = .1, axis_label_size = 7, axis_label_face = &quot;bold&quot;)) set.seed(2020) ## Preprocessing Steps pbmc_small &lt;- NormalizeData(object = pbmc_small, normalization.method = &quot;LogNormalize&quot;, scale.factor = 10000) pbmc_small &lt;- RunPCA(object = pbmc_small) pbmc_small &lt;- FindClusters(object = pbmc_small, reduction = &quot;pca&quot;, dims.use = 1:10, resolution = 1, print.output = 0) pbmc_counts &lt;- as.matrix(pbmc_small@assays$RNA@data) pbmc_meta &lt;- pbmc_small@meta.data gene_names &lt;- rownames(pbmc_counts) pbmc_FitGoM &lt;- FitGoM(t(pbmc_counts), K=4) omega &lt;- data.frame(pbmc_FitGoM$fit$omega) annotation &lt;- data.frame(sample_id = rownames(omega), tissue_label = paste0(&quot;cluster&quot;, pbmc_small@active.ident)) colnames(omega) &lt;- paste0(&quot;topic&quot;, 1:4) rownames(omega) &lt;- annotation$sample_id; StructureGGplot(omega = omega, annotation = annotation, palette = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(4, &quot;Dark2&quot;), yaxis_label = &quot;Cells&quot;, order_sample = TRUE, axis_tick = list(axis_ticks_length = .1, axis_ticks_lwd_y = .1, axis_ticks_lwd_x = .1, axis_label_size = 7, axis_label_face = &quot;bold&quot;)) # ## Add Topic Scores to Meta Data Part of the Seurat Object pbmc_small &lt;- AddMetaData(pbmc_small, omega) pbmc_small@meta.data %&gt;% group_by(RNA_snn_res.1) %&gt;% summarise(topic1 = mean(topic1), topic2 = mean(topic2), topic3 = mean(topic3), topic4 = mean(topic4)) ## ggplot object, you can add layers p1 &lt;- DimPlot(pbmc_small, reduction = &quot;tsne&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Resolution 1&quot;) ## return ggplot object p1 p2 &lt;- FeaturePlot(object = pbmc_small, features = c(&quot;topic1&quot;, &quot;topic2&quot;, &quot;topic3&quot;, &quot;topic4&quot;), cols = c(&quot;grey&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), reduction = &quot;tsne&quot;) ## return ggplot object p2 CombinePlots(list(p1, p2)) 8.3.3.2 Extract Top Feature theta_mat &lt;- pbmc_FitGoM$fit$theta top_features &lt;- ExtractTopFeatures(theta_mat, top_features=100, method=&quot;poisson&quot;, options=&quot;min&quot;) gene_list &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:dim(top_features$indices)[1], function(x) gene_names[top_features$indices[x,]])) We tabulate the top 5 genes for these 4 topics out_table &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:4, function(i) toString(gene_list[i,1:5]))) rownames(out_table) &lt;- paste(&quot;Topic&quot;, c(1:4)) out_table 8.3.4 Practice Visualizing/Embedding 8.3.4.1 tSNE Change the parameter settings for tSNE RunTSNE() 8.3.4.2 UMAP Change the parameter settings for UMAP RunUMAP() 8.4 Other Options For Analysis More Seurat Vignettes Single Cell Analysis Workshop Hemberg Lab Course SingleCellExperiment Scanpy Pegasus "],

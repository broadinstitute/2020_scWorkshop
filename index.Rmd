# Introduction

## COURSE OVERVIEW

In recent years single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has become widely used for transcriptome analysis in many areas of biology. In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq provides quantitative measurements of the expression of every gene in a single cell. However, to analyze scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some of the underlying assumptions for the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid. In this course we will cover all steps of the scRNA-seq processing, starting from the raw reads coming off the sequencer. The course includes common analysis strategies, using state-of-the-art methods and we also discuss the central biological questions that can be addressed using scRNA-seq.


## TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACKGROUND

This course is aimed at researchers and technical workers who are or will be analyzing scRNA-seq data. The material is suitable both for experimentalists who want to learn more about data-analysis as well as computational biologists who want to learn about scRNASeq methods. Examples demonstrated in this course can be applied to any experimental protocol or biological system.

The requirements for this course are:
  1.  Working knowledge of unix (managing files, running programs)
  2. Programming experience in R (writing a function, basic I/O operations, variable types, using packages). Bioconductor  experience is a plus. 
  3. Familiarity with next-generation sequencing data and its analyses (using alignment and quantification tools for bulk sequencing data)


## COURSE FORMAT

The course will be delivered over the course of five days. Each day will include a lecture and laboratory component. The lecture will introduce the topics of discussion and the laboratory sessions will be focused on practical hands-on analysis of scRNA-seq data. These sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as applying these skills on your own to complete individual exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a group. Computing will be done using a combination of tools installed on the attendees laptop computer and web resources accessed via web browser.

#### Poster session with beer & wine (time?)

Poster of current or proposed single cell genomic study. Print out would be good (recent posters are fine), or if you haven’t got a recent one, just a quick one pulled together on powerpoint and printed out on A4 is okay too - you shouldn't stress too much about this, it’s just to connect the flash talks to the posters and it will be absolutely informal (unlike a poster session at a conference!).
Take notes on how to do single-cell analysis, ideas, challenges, things you find interesting, directions you would like to explore.

### Friday – Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 
 

#### Lab 10 - small dataset for analysis

Karthik has a good starting point: Krumlov_lab2_guidelines.html and Hemberg lab http://hemberg-lab.github.io/scRNA.seq.course/advanced-exercises.html
Present a set of methods and orders in which to try them
  - IDH mutated glioma
  - Goal for first half: get to clustering and identify malignant cells (inferCNV possible)
  - Goal for second half: cell states
  - For our other courses, the last day we usually divide them in groups of 3-4 ppl and assign them a small dataset in order to repeat all the analyses they have learnt during the week, to think about the best strategy to carry out the analyses and to present the results in front of the other ppl. I believe this is something very productive and helpful because it is a kind of wrap-up and brainstorming session. Normally, ppl love to talk and present something and in this way they/we can be 100% sure they really understood the different steps of the pipeline.


#### Lecture 9 - Group presentations
